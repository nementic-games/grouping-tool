# Grouping Tool

## Description
The Nementic Grouping Tool is a small Unity tool which groups the selected GameObjects under a new parent GameObject. The parent will be created under the next common parent GameObject of the selected objects. When calling the tool a small pop-up window is shown where the name of the new parent GameObject can be set. The position of the new group can be selected in the position dropdown. You can choose between a local origin position and centered between the child GameObjects. The tool can be called via a shortcut which is configurable in Unity's shortcut manager and the right-click context menu. The pop-up window can be disabled in the preferences and a default label for the group GameObject can be set. Disabling the pop-up window in the preferences will instantly group the selected GameObjects in a group with the default name 'New Group' and the last used group position when the shortcut or the context menu entry is used. Fully supports undo and deeply nested hierarchys.
